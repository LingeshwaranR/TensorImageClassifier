# TensorImageClassifier
Overview
Team DeepThings (Mez Gebre and I) won the Best Product Category at the Deep Learning Hackathon in San Francisco. We developed in three days a real-time system capable of identifying objects and speaking what it sees, thinking about making a useful tool for the visually impaired, as it could make navigation easier. Proof of concept on a laptop, final model running on Android.

This is only the first prototype for Windows.

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
Get the Webcam feed without bottlenecks.
Recognize images using Inception v3.
Text to speech with Google TTS API.
Making a functional model.
Tuninning the parameters.
Output visual display of the results.
